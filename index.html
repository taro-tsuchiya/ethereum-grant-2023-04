    <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left;">
    This research proposal aims to investigate the implications of blockchain censorship, with a particular focus on the impact of the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions on the neutrality and censorship-resistance of permissionless blockchains. The research will formalize, quantify, and analyze the security impact of blockchain censorship, by providing a holistic overview of censorship on the consensus layer and application layer, dissecting the quantitative extent of censorship, and investigating the historical transaction confirmation latency on Ethereum.

        <h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
        
        <p style="text-align:left;">
       The objectives of this research can be grouped into four main areas. The first objective is to define censorship for blockchains, capturing various system layers and temporal features. This will involve providing a clear and comprehensive definition of censorship and identifying the different ways in which censorship can occur within a blockchain system. Specifically, we will focus on censorship on the consensus layer, as validator nodes are responsible for including transactions in a block, and censorship on the application layer, as smart contracts can prevent successful execution of transactions included in a block.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
        The second objective of this research is to quantify the extent of censorship performed by Ethereum smart contracts, block builders, block proposers, and block relayers. To achieve this objective, we will analyze public blockchain data to identify instances of censorship and the actors involved in them. We will specifically focus on the impact of OFAC sanctions on the trustless Tornado Cash applications and compare the situation on Ethereum with the on on Bitcoin where the trust requiring Bitcoin mixer Blender.io has also been sactioned.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
        The third objective is to provide quantitative evidence of the historical transaction confirmation latency on Ethereum. We will investigate the time it takes for a transaction to be confirmed and included in a block on the Ethereum blockchain, before and after the implementation of OFAC sanctions. We will also examine the impact of Ethereum’s move to Proposer/Builder Separation (PBS) on transaction confirmation latency and inclusion delays. Special focus will be put on the distinction between interactions with sanctioned entities such as the Tornado Cash Pool contracts and the TORN token, which represents an ERC-20 token that part of Tornado Cash's governance structure. By examining the impact on TORN we can draw conclusions on the potential impact of sanctions on other similar tokens.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
        By achieving these objectives, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the extent and impact of blockchain censorship, with a particular focus on the impact of OFAC sanctions on the neutrality and security of permissionless blockchains. We expect to provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of blockchain systems and the ways in which they can be compromised by malicious actors or third-party interventions. We also expect to identify potential solutions and strategies for increasing the resilience of blockchain systems against censorship and other related threats.
        </p>

        <h2 id="services">Outcomes</h2>
        
        <p style="text-align:left;">
        The first outcome is a comprehensive understanding of the extent of blockchain censorship and its impact on the security of permissionless blockchains. By providing a clear and comprehensive definition of censorship, as well as quantitative evidence of the extent and actors involved in censorship, we aim to provide a detailed understanding of the ways in which censorship can compromise the security and neutrality of blockchain systems.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:left;">
        The second outcome of this research is comparision of the impact of the OFAC sanctions on privacy-enhancing applications on the Bitcoin and the Ethereum blockchain. While Tornado Cash funcitons fully decentrally, Blender.io was a trust-required application that can be more easily corrupted in censoring attempts than than distributed, autonomous applications.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
        Third, we provide quantitative evidence of the historical transaction confirmation latency on Ethereum and the imapct of censorship. By analyzing the time it takes for transactions to be confirmed and included in a block, we aim to provide valuable insights into the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with sanction-based transaction confirmation delays.

        <h2 id="scope">Methodology</h2>
        To achieve our research objectives, we plan to follow the following methodology:

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Collect data:</b> The proposed research will require extensive data collection from blockchain networks, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. This will involve collecting blockchain data and transaction logs to identify instances of censorship, including the actors involved in implementing censorship and the extent of its impact on the blockchain network. We will also collect data on transaction confirmation latency and inclusion delays, before and after the implementation of OFAC sanctions, to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with transaction confirmation delays. Data collection will be an important component of this research, and we will use a range of data analysis techniques and software to extract and analyze the data in a rigorous and systematic manner.</b> 
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Data visualisation:</b> Data visualization will be an important component of this research to uncover instances of censorship and create comparable visualizations of the data. We will use a range of visualization techniques to identify patterns and trends in the data. These visualizations will be used to uncover instances of censorship and to compare the impact of OFAC sanctions on different blockchain networks, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. The visualizations will be used to highlight the potential impact of censorship on the security and neutrality of blockchain systems. By using a range of visualization techniques, we aim to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the data, and to identify patterns and trends that may be missed by more traditional data analysis techniques.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Data Analysis:</b> The analysis of our data will be a crucial part of this research, and we will use a range of statistical methods to analyze the data and identify patterns and trends. Specifically, we will use hypothesis testing  to test the significance of our findings. The use of statistical methods will be critical to the success of this research, as it will allow us to draw meaningful conclusions from the data and to provide rigorous and robust evidence to support our findings. Overall, the analysis of our data will be a key component of this research, and we will use a range of statistical methods to analyze the data in a rigorous and systematic manner.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Interpretation:</b> We aim to provide insights into the vulnerabilities and threats facing public blockchain systems and the potential strategies and solutions for increasing their resilience against censorship. We will use a range of data analysis techniques to interpret the data, including statistical analysis and data modeling. The findings will be interpreted in the context of existing literature and research on blockchain security and censorship-resilience, and we will compare our findings to previous studies to identify areas of agreement and disagreement. We will also use our findings to identify potential strategies and solutions for increasing the resilience of public blockchain systems against censorship.
            </li>

           
            
        </ol>
